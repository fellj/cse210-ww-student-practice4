    /*

    Program Specification #
     
     Write a program that has a base Event class along with derived classes for each type of event. 
     These classes should contain the necessary data and provide methods to return strings for each of the 
     messages the company desires.
     
     Remember that any data or methods that are common among all types of events should be in the base class.
     
     Once you have the classes in place, write a program that creates at least one event of each type and sets 
     all of their values. Then, for each event, call each of the methods to generate the marketing messages and 
     output their results to the screen.
     
     In addition, your program must:
     
     1. Use inheritance to avoid duplicating shared attributes and methods.
     2. Use an address class for the addresses.
     3. Follow the principles of encapsulation, making sure each member variable is private.
